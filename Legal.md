# Privacy and Security Information
In order for the bot to function, the bot uses some user data and server data, ex: usernames, IDs, and this document will explain how and why.

## Data We Use

**- User IDs:** We use your user ID to ensure that the queue service functions properly, and that the "host" of the session can be easily discerned by the bot.\
**- Server IDs:** We use these to keep server queue lists in their respective servers when the bot has multiple queues going on in multiple servers.\

## Why Do We Need & How We Use The Data
This data is used throughout the bot to make it work without storing the data above. it would not be possible for H4LOMB to function. The data stated above is used for the purposes stated above, and nothing else. We will never give out the information we use to unauthorized users.

## Security
All data and bot services are protected by authentication and access is limited to one person, H4LO. If you believe you have found a security issue in one of our systems, **do not** post in a public chat. DM the developer (`h4l0.`) with information and they will investigate.

## Concerns
If you have any concerns about the data we store or the functions of the bot, please contact the developer of the bot directly by [email](mailto:admin@h4lo.ca) or [direct message.](https://discord.com/users/617800457469034507)  
I'll be more than happy to clear up any concerns you may have.

If you would like your data to be removed, you'll be overjoyed to hear that H4LOMB does not store any data, this is because all data is not stored, it's **used** in the moment.
